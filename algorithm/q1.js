// Question 1

// Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he needs your help.

// #### Task

// You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (`*`) characters. Trailing spaces should not be removed, but every line must be terminated with a newline character (`\n`).

// Return `null/nil/None/`... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.

// #### Examples

// A size 3 diamond:

// ```bash
//  *
// ***
//  *
// ```

// A size 5 diamond:

// ```bash
//   *
//  ***
// *****
//  ***
//   *
// ```
